Writing

Rewriting
Refactoring


Writing code is a process of understanding
Expressing the problem in a good way. What is a good way.
Just like prose?
Readable, understandable, clear, concise. Omit needless words.
Reveals intent.

Writing code is writing. Drafts and rewrites. DHH talk.

Writing and rewriting has effects: 
    - understanding the problem, 
    - clarifying the solution concepts in your head.

Writing guidelines apply: ommit needless words. (There was an article about classical writig. Or was it a video? No, it was an article. about XVIII-XIXth century writers)
